## Project Description

The project demonstrates the use of ensemble learning techniques to build robust machine learning models. The following ensemble methods are implemented:

1. **Random Forest Classifier**
2. **AdaBoost Classifier**
3. **Stacking Classifier**

These models are trained and tested on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KushagraSaxena77/Ensemble_Model.git
cd Ensemble_Model
```

2. Run the `ensemble.py` script:

```bash
python ensemble.py
```

The script will train the models and print their accuracy on the test set.
